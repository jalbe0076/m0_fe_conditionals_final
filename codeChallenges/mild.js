//Write a JavaScript program that defines a variable that stores a Number. 
//The program should print out the String "even" if the Number is even, and the String "odd" if the Number is odd. 
//Hint: You may need to do some extra research on the remainder operator (%) to solve this challenge.

var myNumber = 4324323;

if (myNumber % 2 === 0) {
    console.log("even");
} else {
    console.log("odd");
}
